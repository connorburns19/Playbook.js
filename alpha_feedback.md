Nice job!

Unfortunately, the main functionality of the library was not implemented, which is the ability to create plays and animations. As it stands, your Alpha release is a playbook creation library, which is fine, but very far from what you desire, with very little user benefit (since the images still need to be retrieved from somewhere else). This is why you were graded 3.5 for the functionalities, which is what we are giving to projects that are still a bit far to fulfill their proposed potential.

Your report was very well written, though, which boosted your marks significantly.

<ins>Example page:</ins> you got full marks, but the elements are strangely zoomed in/too big. Moreover, next time, I suggest including Javascript snippets after the description of each example (and before you show the library's output for each of them). Like Description -> Snippet -> Output, and repeat for each example.

<ins>API calls:</ins> you mention something along the lines of API calls in the text, but we were looking for a list of available calls, complete with function names, required arguments and description.

<ins>About the feedback you requested for SVG animations:</ins> they don't need to be SVG at all. You can dynamically change the position of objects of the DOM using Javascript, which is what you should do to implement these features. This is much more interesting from a grading perspective. Check JQuery's .animate() function, which is powerful for what you want to do. Try to polish this as much as possible for the next phase and you should be able to get a very good grade.
