    <div class="outer-text" id='yuh'>The main functionality for my alpha release is the virtual Playbook.
        The first use case is: Consider you devloping for a football coach, and they have a website for their team.
        You could create a Playbook Object and put it on the webpage. You would choose to not allow the players to add
        plays,
        so you would not call the allowUserCreatePlays method in the js file. You would then add all the coach wants the
        players
        to be able to view.
